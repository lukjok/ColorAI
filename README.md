# ColorAI
### AI based color recogniser made with ML.NET and ASP.NET Core

In short: This idea came from one project where product color picker was needed and there were only color names. There were a few color libraries but these did not have all color definitions.
The AI model I am using is [Color-Names](https://github.com/airalcorn2/Color-Names) converted to the ONNX format. You can check it out for more information about the model and it's capabilities.
For the runtime itself used the ML.NET framework and ASP.NET Core for the web API.
